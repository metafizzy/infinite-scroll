You can add to and/or override those community defaults below. Changes entered here will affect only your site on a single-site install, and only your network's site on a multisite install."

In most cases, identifying each of your theme's elements below simply requires entering either the element's ID indicated with a hashmark, (<em>e.g.,</em><code>#content</code>), or the element's class indicated by a period, (<em>e.g.,</em><code>.post</code>). For more information, please see <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors\">jQuery's CSS Selector documentation</a>."
